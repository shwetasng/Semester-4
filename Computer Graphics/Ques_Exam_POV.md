2. Justify that Open GL platform independent with proper explanation.
3. Differentiate between DDA Line and Brasenham Line Drawing algorithm
and Implement the DDA line algorithm to draw a line from (0,0) to (6,7) and
explain each step
4. Use Cohen Sutherland line clipping algorithm to clip line P1(70,20) and P2(100,10) 
against a lower left hand corner (10,10) and upper right hand corner (80,40) and after
clipping to find the intersection point. Also, define CRT with proper diagram.
