## 1.What are inline functions?
An inline function is one for which the compiler copies the code from the function definition directly into the code of the calling function rather than creating a separate set of instructions in memory. This eliminates call-linkage overhead and can expose significant optimization opportunities. Using the "inline" specifier is only a suggestion to the compiler that an inline expansion can be performed; the compiler is free to ignore the suggestion.
## 2. What is Moonlighting?
Moonlighting is a practice where employees secretly take up a second job or other work assignments along with their full-time job.
## 3. What is DNS and how is it used?
DNS, or the Domain Name System, translates human readable domain names (for example, www.amazon.com) to machine readable IP addresses (for example, 192.0.2.44).

All computers on the Internet, from your smart phone or laptop to the servers that serve content for massive retail websites, find and communicate with one another by using numbers. These numbers are known as IP addresses. When you open a web browser and go to a website, you don't have to remember and enter a long number. Instead, you can enter a domain name like example.com and still end up in the right place.

A DNS service such as Amazon Route 53 is a globally distributed service that translates human readable names like www.example.com into the numeric IP addresses like 192.0.2.1 that computers use to connect to each other. The Internetâ€™s DNS system works much like a phone book by managing the mapping between names and numbers. DNS servers translate requests for names into IP addresses, controlling which server an end user will reach when they type a domain name into their web browser. These requests are called queries.
## 4. What is host id, network id, broadcast id, network interface?
A Network ID is the unique identifier for a specific network on a larger network such as the Internet. It is usually a set of numbers or letters associated with a particular network. A Host ID is the unique identifier for a computer or other device connected to a network. It can be either a static or dynamic IP address assigned to the device, or a MAC address. A Broadcast ID is a special type of IP address that allows data to be sent to all devices on a network at once. The broadcast address is typically the highest IP address within the network's range of addresses.
A host ID is a unique identifier used to identify a particular device on a computer network. On a TCP/IP network, a host ID is equivalent to the IP address assigned to the device. A network interface (also known as a network interface card, network adapter, LAN adapter, and by similar terms) is a computer hardware component that connects a computer to a computer network.
## 5. What is a parity bit?
A parity bit is a check bit, which is added to a block of data for error detection purposes. It is used to validate the integrity of the data. The value of the parity bit is assigned either 0 or 1 that makes the number of 1s in the message block either even or odd depending upon the type of parity. Parity check is suitable for single bit error detection only.
