## 1.What are inline functions?
An inline function is one for which the compiler copies the code from the function definition directly into the code of the calling function rather than creating a separate set of instructions in memory. This eliminates call-linkage overhead and can expose significant optimization opportunities. Using the "inline" specifier is only a suggestion to the compiler that an inline expansion can be performed; the compiler is free to ignore the suggestion.
