    ANS: USING VPN:-
    Virtual Private Network, or VPN (there are also free VPN providers), is the safest mode of using the internet. It is your ultimate solution for all the hacking and malware issues. VPN provides you an encrypted tunnel for all your online activities, making sure nobody can get access to your data to and from your network. This eliminates all the chances of spying and snooping on your online activities and make it impossible for cybercriminals to direct malware toward your device. It further disguises your actual identity and location by allowing you to access the internet through remote servers, eliminating all chances of IP address hacking. VPN protected networks and devices are very hard to hack and misuse.
    
    USING PROXY SERVER:-
    A proxy server is an intermediary server through which your traffic is routed:The internet servers you visit see only the IP address of that proxy server and not your IP address.When those servers send information back to you, it goes to the proxy server, which then routes it to you.
A drawback of proxy servers is that some of the services can spy on you â€” so you need to trust it. Depending on which one you use, they can also insert ads into your browser.
